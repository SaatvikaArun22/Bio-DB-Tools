# Bio-DB Tools

A curated set of interactive web applications built to explore and visualize biological data. These tools were developed as part of the *Biological Database Analysis* course at Boston University, and reflect my interest in combining front-end web development with real-world bioinformatics applications.

Each module connects to biological datasets and demonstrates client-server integration using HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, and backend scripting (Flask, PHP, or SQL). The goal is to create lightweight, accessible tools that allow users to interact with biological data in a meaningful way — whether it’s querying gene annotations or visualizing expression profiles.

## 🗂️ Contents

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `gene_search_app/` | Query genes by name, ID, or symbol using live search and display results with biological context. |
| `mirna_plot_viewer/` | Visualize miRNA targeting scores using histograms and interactive filters. |
| `ppi_network_explorer/` | Select a disease and visualize its protein–protein interaction network using Cytoscape.js. |
| `expression_query_interface/` | Dynamic table-based search of gene expression data with export options. |
